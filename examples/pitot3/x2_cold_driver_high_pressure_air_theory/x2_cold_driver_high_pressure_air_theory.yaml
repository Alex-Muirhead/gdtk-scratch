# x2_cold_driver_high_pressure_air_theoryyaml: 
#
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for a high pressure, cold driven X2 condition from 
# the NUS project.
# This is the condition from Cullen et al. (2021)
# Infrared thermography on a biconic model in hypersonic
# expansion tube flows
