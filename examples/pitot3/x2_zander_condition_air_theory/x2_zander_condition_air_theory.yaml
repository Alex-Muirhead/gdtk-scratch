# x2_zander_condition_air_theory.yaml: 
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for the Zander condition which is a commonly 
# used X2 air test condition which was first used
# in Zander et al. (2013)
# Hot-Wall Reentry Testing in Hypersonic Impulse Facilities
# AIAA Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2, February 2013
# After this, it has been used for most heated model work at UQ.
