# x2_zander_condition_air_theory_custom_ideal_gas_test_gas.yaml
#
# This example is the similar to the standard x2_zander_condition_air_theory
# example, however, the test gas (which is the same as the other example)
# is instead specified as a custom ideal gas test gas which is stored
# in the same folder as the simulation.
# Just a note that this simple is ideal gas so the shock speeds
# overestimate the equilibrium gas result and I had to reduce the wedge
# angle to keep the wedge attached.
# The test condition is still the Zander condition which is a commonly 
# used X2 air test condition which was first used
# in Zander et al. (2013)
# Hot-Wall Reentry Testing in Hypersonic Impulse Facilities
# AIAA Journal, Vol. 51, No. 2, February 2013
# After this, it has been used for most heated model work at UQ.
