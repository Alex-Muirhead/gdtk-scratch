# x2_titan_8_point_5_km_s_theory.yaml: 
# This is a config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for the 8.5 km/s Titan entry condition from
# Hadas Porat's PhD.
# NOTE: I have used what I called the 'legacy' Titan
# composition in this example, as that is what Hadas used.
# I would not recommend using it for new experiments, as
# NASA (and others) seem to have moved to compositions with
# less CH4 and/or some Argon in it now.
# The condition data can be found in Table 3.1 of that work:
# Porat (2015)
# Measurement of Radiative Heat Transfer in Simulated Titan and
# Mars Atmospheres in Expansion Tubes
