# x3_hayabusa_condition_air_theory.yaml: 
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for Andreas Andrianatos' X3 Hayabusa condition
# from his PhD thesis
# Ground Testing at Superorbital Flight Conditions in a Large Scale Expansion Tube
# The driver condition is what he himself estimated worked best to re-create his 
# shock tube shock speed using PITOT2 in the past
