# x2_titan_nrst.yaml: 
# This is a config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 X2 NRST case.
# This is not a real condition which we have fired 
# before (as X2 has been extensively upgraded 
# since the last time we did Titan NRST work)
# I just picked a fill pressure from the last 
# NASA EAST Titan paper:
# Brandis and Cruden (2017)
# Titan Atmospheric Entry Radiative Heating
# 47th AIAA Thermophysics Conference
# and picked a X2 driver condition to roughly match it
