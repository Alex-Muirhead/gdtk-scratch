# x2_venus_theory.yaml: 
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for the 2mm driver A condition from Table 6.1 in 
# Guerric Guerric de Crombrugghe de Looringhe's PhD thesis
# I did this condition as we fired it recently on X2.
# On Binary Scaling, and Ground-to-Flight Extrapolation in High-Enthalpy Facilities
# It seems to match the experimental shock speeds pretty well.
# Just a small note too that Guerric used a freestream composition of
# 97%CO2/3%N2 (by volume) but PITOT3 is now using the more accurate
# 96.5%CO2/3.5%N2 (by volume) in its default CEA Venus entry mixture.
