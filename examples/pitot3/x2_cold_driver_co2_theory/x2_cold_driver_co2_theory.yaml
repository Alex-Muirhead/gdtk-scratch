# x2_cold_driver_co2_theory.yaml: 
#
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 case for a cold driven CO2 X2 condition from the work of
# Sangdi Gu.
# This is the condition from Gu et al. (2021)
# An Experimental Study of CO2 Thermochemical Nonequilibrium
# AIAA Journal 
# https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J061037
# NOTE: as I pushed this, as the nozzle calculation
# is failing for this condition. I hope to be able to fix this soon...
