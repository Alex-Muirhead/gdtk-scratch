# x2_uranus_entry_with_secondary_driver_theory.yaml: 
# This is a simple config file to run a fully theoretical
# PITOT3 Uranus entry case with a secondary driver.
# This is the fastest condition ever tested on X2,
# that is not a brag, just saying that it is a stressful case
# for the code.
# The condition is from James et al. (2020)
# Experimentally Simulating Giant Planet Entry in an Expansion Tube
# Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 57, No. 4
# In that work, the condition is called X2-GG-UE-2.5 mm-SD
