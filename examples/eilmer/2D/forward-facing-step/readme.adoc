This example shows the flow of gas at Mach 3 over a forward-facing step in a duct.
The test case was first proposed by Emery (1968) and is described as a two-dimensional step.
However, in the literature, this test case is often cited for its use
in the paper by Woodward and Colella (1984) which tested the capabilities of
various difference schemes for treating strong shocks.
They describe this case as a Mach 3 Wind Tunnel with a Step.
