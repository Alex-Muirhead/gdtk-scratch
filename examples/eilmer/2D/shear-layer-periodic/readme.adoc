This two-dimensional flow has a positive x-velocity in the upper half of the domain and
a negative x-velocity in the lower half.
A finite-width shear layer with a linear variation in x-velocity separates these high-speed regions.
The y-velocity is initially perturbed, most strongly in the middle of the domain,
diminishing toward the north and south boundaries, which are ideal flat walls that allow slip.
The west and east boundaries are connected such that the flow is periodic in the x-direction.
The flow is allowed to evolve, with the initial shear layer vorticity rolling into distinct cores
that are distorted as the acoustic waves propagate between the slip-wall boundaries.
The animation above uses a grid-refinement factor of 4 and the corresponding simulation run time
is a bit less than an hour on a workstation with a few cores.
The input script checked into the repository has a lower factor of 2, which requires only a few minutes to run.
Note that the animation shows three periods of the computed flow field: the original plus two copies translated
in the x-direction.
