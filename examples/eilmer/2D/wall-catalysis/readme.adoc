This example exercises the mass fraction boundary conditions for a blunt wedge with an elevated temperature of 2200K, immersed in a hypersonic flow at 6 km/s.
The left hand image shows the mass fraction of molecular nitrogen (N2), using a normal fixed temperature wall where the mass fraction gradients are set to zero.
Note the drop in N2 as the gas passes through the shock layer and begins to dissociate.
In contrast the right hand image uses a fully catalytic wall, where the mass fraction values are set to their equilibrium composition --- effectively assuming that the wall accelerates the reaction rates all the way to completion. 
Note the layer of red against the wall of this image, demonstrating that the wall is forcing some of the nitrogen molecules to recombine, despite its elevated temperature. 

This effect can significantly increase the heat transferred to the surface from the fluid, as shown in the figure below. 
The "q_diff" term represents the additional heat transfer from chemical activity at the surface, which is only present in the catalytic wall case.
