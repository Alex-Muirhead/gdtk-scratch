This shock-fitting example shows the transient flow of a hydrogen/oxygen gas mixture 
over a spherical projectile.
The test case is derived from the experiments by Lehr (1972) with conditions corresponding
to Figure 5 of his original paper.  
The glyphs overlaid on the animation are points manually digitized from the shock front in that figure.
