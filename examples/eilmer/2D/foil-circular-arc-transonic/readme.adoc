This example shows the transonic flow around an airfoil with a circular-arc profile.
It appears to be a standard example in the textbooks on Computational Fluid Dynamics,
where the solution for the full potential equations are discussed.
Note that, effectively, the Euler equations solved here.
Also, the image does not show the complete flow domain used for the simulation.
The upper boundary is 6 chord lengths above the lower boundary and the inlet and outlet
boundaries are each 5 chord lengths from the airfoil.
