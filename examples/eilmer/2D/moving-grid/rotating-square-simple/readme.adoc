This example displays a square in Mach 6 free flight conditions, following a prescribed rotational motion.
The implementation of dynamics builds on the ideas illustrated in the piston example above, and are defined by the user.

Taking \(\theta\) as the angle of the square face relative to incoming flow \((\theta_0 = 0)\), the dynamics were defined by the rotational velocity \(\omega\):
\[\omega(t) = A \cos((2 \pi / t_f) \cdot t)\]

Where \(A = 2000\) (rad/s). This formulation ensures a large sweep of angles are completed over the simulation time \([0,t_f]\), while also enusuring the square finishes at it's starting angle relative to the incoming flow.

The inflow conditions for this simulation are:

* freestream pressure: 760 Pa
* freestream temperature: 71 K
* freestream V: 1005.0 m/s

Results from the simulation are shown below (flow startup omitted):
