This example simulates the flow of air over a hollow cylinder and the induced heat transfer into the cylinder.
It is an example of using the Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) solver in Eilmer for coupled fluid/solid domain simulations.
In the CHT solver, the Navier-Stokes equations are solved on the fluid domain and an energy conservation equation is solved on the solid domain.
A special boundary condition ensures the temperature and heat flux match at the interface between the solid and fluid domains.
More details can be found in the article by Veeraragavan et al. (2016).

The particular conditions for this example are chosen to replicate the physical experiments performed by Wieting (1987).
The simulation uses an explicit time integration scheme to simulate 5 seconds of flow.
An animation of the solution above shows a bow shock quickly forming upstream of the cylinder before a slow but noticeable increase in the cylinder's temperature can be observed.
Wieting provides surface temperature measurements for this flow condition which can be used for validation purposes.
A comparison of the surface temperature of the cylinder to the experiment is shown here.
