== Preparation
There are preparation scripts available in this directory, one for each version (1T or 2T).
There is an assumption that the scripts will be executed in this directory;
they copy files from nearby directories for the chemistry and kinetics inputs.

To prepare file for 1-T work:

    $ ./prep-1T-version.sh

or for 2-T work:

    $ ./prep-2T-version.sh


== Usage
After preparation, you can copy the generated files for use in Eilmer/nenzf1d/etc to your simulation
working directory.
The tables below show which files are required.

.For 1-T work
|===
| File type          | name

| Gas model file     | `air-5sp-He-1T.gas`

| Chemistry file     | `GuptaEtAl-air-reactions.chem`

|===


.For 2-T work
|===
| File type          | name

| Gas model file     | `air-5sp-He-2T.gas`

| Chemistry file     | `GuptaEtAl-air-reactions-2T.chem`

| Kinetics file      | `air-energy-exchange.kin`
