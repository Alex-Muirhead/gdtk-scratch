This document is to record and refine our thoughts on what aspects of the Eilmer simulation program would make it into an
"official" Eilmer 4.0 release.
I have tried to categorise the features, but unavoidably some
features leak across category boundaries.

== Documentation

In general, we'd like complete documentation for all features that are included in the release. At a minimum, no aspects of the documentation should look "obviously incomplete".

. Theory book
. Catalogue of examples
. Detailed notes on examples (LaTeX doc 'in' examples directories) 

== Core simulation loop (time-stepping)

. explicit timestepping with
.. euler
.. predictor-corrector
.. RK3 schemes
.. local timestepping (LTS)

== Dimensionality, reference frames and grid types
. 2D and 3D
. fixed and rotatin frames
. structured and unstrutured grids

== Parallelism
. shared-memory
. MPI (should work with all features in release)

== Gas modelling and kinetic effects
. ideal gas
. thermally perfect gas
  .. with finite-rate chemistry
. equilibrium gas (connected to Nick's eq calculator)
. two-temperature air
. vibrationally-specific N2 gas

== Moving grid
. general user-defined motions
. shock-fitting

== Turbulence models
. k-omega
.. with wall functions

== Conjugate coupling
. fluid solid domains in 2D/3D supported

== Boundary conditions
. all should work in context of supported gas models (where that is sensible in a physical modelling sense)
. catalytic BC (simplified) included so that mass diffusion has relevance

== User-defined functions for customisation
. included in features, need work on conveying Lua error messages out to caller in meaningful way

== Block-marching
. included as feature, needs documentation on its application

== Features NOT included

This might not be an exhaustive list, but really everything not listed above should be considered experimental.
This includes:
. accelerators to steady-state
.. Newton-Krylov
.. LU-SGS
.. STS
. features using hardware accelerators
. adjoint solver
. Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model
