The computation of the nozzle flow in T5 is normally performed
with a block-marching scheme which takes much less time than a
time-accurate method. However, if one wants to study the 
time-dependence of the flow in the test section, it is necessary 
to use the latter. For that case, it is most convenient to start
from a known throat flow state, so that the whole of the flow is 
supersonic. Fortunately, it is a good approximation to
compute the throat state with
a one-dimensional equilibrium method in the usual way, from the
initial shock-tube state, the shock speed and the reservoir
pressure. Since the reservoir pressure varies with time in a 
known (measured) fashion, repeated applications of this method yield 
the flow state at the throat at discrete times. 
The software package Eilmer4
provides the feature of specifying an inflow boundary condition
that depends on time, through a file that gives the flow state
as a function of time. In this report I describe how this method is
used to compute time traces of the nozzle exit conditions for two T5 runs.

= Computation of the transient throat state

For this task I use the one-dimensional nozzle-flow code of the
gas-dynamics toolkit of the Centre for Hypersonics of the University
of Queensland which is called nenzf1d. The input to this code 
consists of the initial shock tube state (gas composition, temperature 
and pressure), the shock speed and the reservoir pressure, as
well as the specification of the equilibrium behavior of the gas
in the form of the files called `gas.lua` and
`cea-air5species-gas-model.lua`, and the relaxation behavior of the
gas in the form of the files called `chem.lua` and `kinetics.lua`.
In my case the gas is air and the model is the Bose/Candler
5-species 6-reaction 2-temperature model. In addition nenzf1d requires
the nozzle shape to be provided in the form of a few Bezier points.
In the case at hand the part of nenzf1d that computes the 
one-dimensional flow through the nozzle is not needed, and only the
condition at the throat that it supplies is used. All the named
files as well as an example input file `t5-air-2T.yaml` and the 
corresponding output file `47` accompany this report.

In the output file `47` the part of interest is the flow state
at the throat. This is given just after the line that states:
`Begin part B: continue supersonic expansion with finite-rate chemistry.`
This part of the output gives velocity, speed of sound, pressure,
temperature, vibrational temperature and composition. The first step 
is to choose a point on the reservoir-pressure trace, 
see figure <<pressure-trace-2946>>, noting the time and the pressure. Then this
pressure is used in the input file to nenzf1d. The throat flow state
in the resulting output is then transcribed together with the time
into a line in the file "throat-file.dat" (an example of which 
accompanies this report). This is repeated for other time/pressure
pairs with suitably densely
spaced times along the trace, till the period of interest is covered.
Since the boundary layer in the nozzle is partially turbulent, the
throat file needs an additional parameter for the turbulence model,
which in my case is the Spalart-Allmaras model.

= Nozzle flow computation

The next step is to run the nozzle-start program in Euler4. (See 
accompanying file `t5ns.lua`.) This requires as input the same gas
files, that are now actually used, as well as the nozzle profile
which is specified as a spline through many coordinate points. 
In `t5ns.lua` the inflow
boundary condition is the file `throat-file.dat` which is invoked by          
`west=InFlowBC_Transient:new{fileName = "throat-file.dat"}`
in the specification of the boundary conditions.
Running this computation with MPI and 48 processors takes about 
one day with the resolution I have chosen (2560x92 cells),
heavily clustered towards the nozzle wall 
for good resolution of the  boundary layer.

With a partially turbulent boundary layer it is necessary to specify 
the transition point. Since the nozzle exit pressure is sensitive to the
choice of the transition point, I chose the transition point by tuning
it to give an exit pressure that matches the exit pressure measured
at the mid point of the useful test time. 

= Results

The two conditions considered here were T5-2946 and T5-3029.
Figure <<exit-2946>> shows the distribution of flow variables
along the radius in the nozzle exit plane of T5-2946 at t=1.5ms.
The best location of the transition point in this case was x=0.425m.
The corresponding pressure traces are shown in figure <<ptrace-2946>>.

= Conclusions

A procedure is described by which it is possible to compute the
time-dependent behavior of the test section conditions in T5.
The procedure is applied to two particular T5 runs.
All the files needed for this procedure
accompany this report, in the hope that
one of the graduate students can make the procedure less laborious 
and thus provide a useful tool for future use in T5 research.
