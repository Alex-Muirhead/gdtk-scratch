Control point form grid generation is an algebraic technique to produce structured grids.
It is more powerful than transfinite interpolation because it makes use of internal
control points to give more control on the grid point distribution.
By contrast, a transfinite interpolated grid is completely specified by the boundaries.
The extra control comes at the cost of more input required by the user.
This note documents the background mathematics and gives examples of user input
in terms of control points so that you may see the resulting structured grids.

= Control point formulation in two dimensions ^<<label,1>>^

Equations <<Ej>> and <<Fi>> below are used to generate horizontal and vertical gridlines. The range of horizontal parameter
r is [1, N-1]; the range of vertical parameter s is [1, M-1], where N is the number of control points in horizontal
direction (i = 1, 2, ..., N), and M is the number of control points in vertical direction (j = 1, 2, ..., M). The
transformation from latexmath:[r \in [1,N\]] and latexmath:[s \in [1,M\]] to latexmath:[\hat{r},\hat{s} \in [0,1\]] has been
taken care of in Eilmer. latexmath:[$G_{\alpha}(r)$] and latexmath:[$H_{\beta}(s)$] are the integration functions. 

[latexmath#Ej,reftext={counter:eqs}]
++++
\begin{equation}
E_{j}(r)=C_{1,j}+\displaystyle\sum_{{\alpha}=1}^{N-1} G_{\alpha}(r)(C_{{\alpha}+1,j}-C_{{\alpha}j})
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath#Fi,reftext={counter:eqs}]
++++
\begin{equation}
F_{i}(s)=C_{i,1}+\displaystyle\sum_{{\beta}=1}^{M-1} H_{\beta}(s)(C_{i,{\beta}+1}-C_{i{\beta}})
\end{equation}
++++

Having either latexmath:[$E_{j}(r)$] or latexmath:[$F_{i}(s)$] function, the tensor product form can be produced:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
T(r,s)=E_{1}(r)+\displaystyle\sum_{{\beta}=1}^{M-1} H_{\beta}(s)(E_{\beta+1}(r)-E_{\beta}(r))
\end{equation}
++++

or

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
T(r,s)=F_{1}(s)+\displaystyle\sum_{{\alpha}=1}^{N-1} G_{\alpha}(r)(F_{\alpha+1}(s)-F_{\alpha}(s)) .
\end{equation}
++++

To ensure the grid conforms precisely to prescribed boundaries, the Boolean sum is used. P(1,s), P(N-1,s),
P(r,1) and P(r,M-1) in Equation \eqref{myeq5} are the west, east, south and north boundary, respectively.

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Q(r,s) = & T(r,s) + \\
         & + (1-G_1(r))(P(1,s)-F_1(s)) \\
         & + G_{N-1}(r)(P(N-1,s)-F_N(s)) \\
         & + (1-H_1(s))(P(r,1)-E_1(r)) \\
         & + H_{M-1}(s)(P(r,M-1)-E_M(r))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

= Usage of ControlPointPatch

`ControlPointPatch:new{south=path~S~, north=path~N~, west=path~W~, east=path~E~, 
control_points=ctrl_pts}`: a control point form surface between the four pathes. The orientation of Path elements
is important. The north and south boundaries progress west to east, and west and east boundaries progress south to
north. 

The control points are stored in a 2D array. The structure of ctrl_pts should be an array of columns of control points. 
In the Lua file, `ctrl_pts[i][j]` gives the control point in latexmath:[$i^{th}$] column and latexmath:[$j^{th}$] row.
The control points progress from south to north vertically and west to east horizontally. The boundary control points do
not have to lie on prescribed boundaries.  

If uniform grid is desired, interior control points should be uniformly distributed, and boundary control points should be
half of the unit spacing from the control points directly adjacent to them. Therefore, the unit spacings in r and s directions are 
latexmath:[$L/(N-2)$] and latexmath:[$H/(M-2)$], respectively, where L and H are length and height of the grid.

The ctrl_pts is defined as an array of columns of control points. 

.Define control points
[#points]
----
L = 1.0
N = 4
M = 5
ctrl_pts = {}
xPos = {0.0, L/4, 3*L/4, L}
yPos = {0.0, L/6, 3*L/6, 5*L/6, L}
for i=1,N do
   ctrl_pts[i] = {}
   for j=1,M do
      ctrl_pts[i][j] = Vector3:new{x=xPos[i], y=yPos[j]}
   end
end
----

The south, north, west and east boundaries are defined by Paths. 

.Define boundaries
[#paths]
----
south = Line:new{p0=ctrl_pts[1][1], p1=ctrl_pts[N][1]}
north = Line:new{p0=ctrl_pts[1][M], p1=ctrl_pts[N][M]}
west = Line:new{p0=ctrl_pts[1][1], p1=ctrl_pts[1][M]}
east = Line:new{p0=ctrl_pts[N][1], p1=ctrl_pts[N][M]}
----

The control point surface and grid can be generated as follows.

.Generate surface and grid
[#surface and grid]
----
ctrlPtPatch = ControlPointPatch:new{north=north, east=east, west=west, south=south, control_points=ctrl_pts}
grid = StructuredGrid:new{psurface=ctrlPtPatch, niv=21, njv=21}

The corresponding grid is shown in Figure 1 (control points and control net in red, gridlines in black).

= Move internal points

Gridlines can be adjusted flexibly by moving internal control points. This example shows the same
unit square with modified internal control points. The new control points locations are:

ctrl_pts[2][2] = Vector3:new{x=xPos[2],y=L/3}
ctrl_pts[2][3] = Vector3:new{x=L/2,y=yPos[3]}
ctrl_pts[2][4] = Vector3:new{x=L/5,y=2*L/3}
ctrl_pts[3][2] = Vector3:new{x=xPos[3],y=L/8}
ctrl_pts[3][3] = Vector3:new{x=3.5*L/4,y=2*L/3}
ctrl_pts[3][4] = Vector3:new{x=xPos[4],y=2.5*L/3}

The resulting grid is displayed in Figure 2.

= Reproduce the duct grid in Eiseman's paper ^<<label,1>>^

Exact boundaries of the duct grid are not given in the paper, so some estimations are used. 

The north and east boundary paths are determined using Bezier curves. The west and south boundary
paths are defined by Line object. 

The control points adjacent to boundaries have half of the unit spacings between them and the control
points at boundaries to get uniform grid.
