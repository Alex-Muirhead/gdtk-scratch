It is easy to include Eilmer flow simulations in an automatic optimization procedure.
This note documents an example of determining the optimal shape of a classic, bell-shaped nozzle
for a rocket motor.

= Background

Rocket nozzles that are designed for producing maximum thrust have a bell-like profile^<<bib1,1>>^.
An example flow field, displayed as pressure and Mach number images, is shown below in Figure 1.
Gas enters the simulation domain at the left at subsonic, high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.
This gas models the combustion products inside the rocket motor with a stagnation temperature
of 3000 K and a stagnation pressure on 5 MPa.
The gas accelerates toward the opening at the nozzle throat and,
if we were to just let the gas vent to atmospheric conditions unbounded from this throat,
we could achieve significant thrust.
We can, however, obtain a higher thrust by adding a (divergent) supersonic part to the nozzle,
as shown in the figure.

This example came from a 2017 class assignment in which students used the Eilmer CFD code
to do their calculations.
They were provided with an input script (shown later) that models a conical nozzle
and a command script that runs a single flow simulation.
They were then able to run test flows for particular nozzle shapes by editing a few parameters
in the input script and then running the Eilmer code.
Output from the flow simulation includes several snapshots of the entire flow field (that may be
used to make pretty pictures, as shown above in Figure 1) and
a small surface-loads file that contained enough data
to compute the thrust on the expanding nozzle surface.
The goal was to select values of the control parameters (that set the shape of the nozzle) so
that they achieved maximum thrust in the axial direction.

In 2017, the students were allowed to decide the particular experimental procedure
for determining good values of the design parameters.
This report shows how to use the Nelder-Mead nonlinear simplex method^<<bib2,2>>,<<bib3,3>>^
in an automated process for deciding what values of the nozzle shape parameters to set.


= Simulation of a particular nozzle

We start by setting up the simulation of the nozzle expansion flow path
that is embedded in a more complete flow domain,
including a bit of the subsonic flow upstream of the nozzle throat and some of the surrounds downstream
of the nozzle exit.
This allows the simulation to start with known stagnation conditions within the body of the motor
and allows the transient flow to develop into a steady supersonic flow in the expanding part
of the nozzle.
Note that the expanding flow in figure 1 is not uniform and shows evidence of
an oblique shock structure within the bell nozzle.
Such detail is handled implicitly within the simulation and all we need to inspect in detail
is the pressure distribution along the expanding wall.
This is provided in a "loads" file writen by Eilmer.


== Defining the nozzle flow path

The supersonic expansion part of the bell nozzle is set up as a variation of a straight conical nozzle.
Four parameters define the particular shape of the bell nozzle via the control points
of a Bezier curve.
These parameters are set at about a third of the way into the script and are the angles: `theta_cone`, `theta_init`, `alpha` and `beta`.

The profile of the divergent part of the nozzle consists of a circular arc,
followed by a Bezier curve.
The Bezier curve has 5 points: `b0`, `b1`, `b2`, `b3` and `b4`.
The angle `theta_init` is also the angle of the polygon segment `b0`-`b1`,
so that we get continuity of slope with the arc from the nozzle throat.
The angle `alpha` sets the position of point `b2`, relative to the start (`b0`).
This allows us to expand even further than the arc or start to compress the flow.
We have a choice.
The angle `theta_cone` sets the position of exit point `b4` and so,
in combination with the initial angle, determines the diameter of the nozzle exit.
The nozzle length (in the x-direction) remains fixed.
The other control angle, `beta`, sets the position of `b3` relative to `b4`,
so that we can choose the exit angle of the flow at the nozzle wall.

With `theta_cone` equal to `theta_init` and `alpha` and `beta` both set to zero, we have a straight
conical nozzle.

== Running a simulation

With a gas model input file containing
[source,lua]
----
model = "IdealGas"
species = {'air'}
----
we can now run a simulation with the commands
[source,shell]
----
prep-gas ideal-air.inp ideal-air-gas-model.lua
e4shared --prep --job=nozzle
e4shared --run --job=nozzle --verbosity=1
e4shared --post --job=nozzle --tindx-plot=all --vtk-xml --add-vars="mach,pitot,total-p,total-h"
----
This particular simulation takes about 86 seconds to run 3740 steps on a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop
with an Intel Core i7-8665U processor.
While running, the htop command indicates that the calculation was getting about 330% of CPU.
This is fair for a shared-memory multi-block simulation that is not well load-balanced.

The post-processing command was used to get some Paraview plotting files for viewing and is
not necessary for estimating the thrust performance of the nozzle expansion as 1954 Newtons.
That information comes from the "loads" file for the surface in the supersonic part of the nozzle.


== The loads file

At the end of the simulation, there will be a `loads` directory and within that one or more
time-snapshot directories containing the actual loads files.
The first four lines of the loads file are:

For each line of data, we need to pick up the values for unit normal in the x-direction `4:n.x`,
the cell-face area `7:area`, and the pressure `10:p`.
Note that, in an axisymmetric simulation such as this one, the area of the face is per radian
around the axis of symmetry.


= Turning the input script into a template

So far, we have set up to manually run a single flow analysis simulation but,
when running simulations within an automatic optimization process,
we want to be able to generate Eilmer input scripts with specific values
of the shape parameters.
To do this, we turn the input script above into a "template" that has target strings
instead of specific numbers.
We change just four lines.
[source,lua]
----
theta_cone = math.rad($theta_cone) -- nominal straight-cone angle
theta_init = math.rad($theta_init) -- starting angle for thrust nozzle
alpha = math.rad($alpha)  -- angle for setting b2 in Bezier curve
beta = math.rad($beta)  -- angle for setting b3 in Bezier curve
----

= The optimization program

The following Python program codifies our process of setting up and running
specific simulations based on out template input script.

The core of the program is the `objective` function that takes a list of parameter values,
sets up and runs a simulation, and returnss the simulated thrust on the expanding nozzle wall.
Note that we have used a thread-safe queue to get a unique job identity for each call
to the objective function.
This allows us to run more than one instance of the objective function concurrently,
which is handy because our implementation of the Nelder-Mead minimizer can replace more than
one simplex point with each step^<<bib4,4>>^.

The `main` function, toward the end of the code, can be run in one of several ways.
It can run just a single simulation, or evaluate a single call to the objective function,
or let the Nelder-Mead minimizer do its thing, running many simulations.

Replacing two simplex points per step and running the objective function evaluations with two workers
in the tead-pool, the tail-end of the console output is:

overall calculation time: 4692.7158970832825

It shows that the overall run time is significantly less than one might expect
for 71 simulations at 85 seconds each (6035 seconds).
Thus it seems that we have made good use of all 8 hyperthreads on the Thinkpad's processor.

The `progress.txt` file that is used to accumulate values of parameters and the objective
during the optimization process is good for showing the history of the calculations.
As shown below, in Figure 3, the optimizer makes an improvement of about 13% on the thrust applied to
the supersonic part of the nozzle expansion.
