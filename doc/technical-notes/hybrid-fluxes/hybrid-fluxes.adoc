= Adaptive flux calculation

We often want to capture flow features that require low dissipation numerical
methods to resolve and yet also contain discontinuities that these schemes
struggle to handle in a stable manner. One way of addressing this issue is to
use adaptive flux solvers which combine two different (but compatible) ways of
calculating the inviscid fluxes, typically a low dissipation but sensitive
solver and the other a highly dissipative but stable solver, and then select
some combination of the two in order to best achieve our requirements. This can
be represented according to,

latexmath:[$F=SF_{A}+\left(1-S\right)F_{B}$]

where latexmath:[$F$] is the final flux, latexmath:[$0\leq S\leq1$] is a
blending variable, and latexmath:[$F_{A}$] and latexmath:[$F_{B}$] are the two
fluxes that are being blended. From this we can see that latexmath:[$F$] can be
equal to latexmath:[$F_{A}$], latexmath:[$F_{B}$], or some linear combination of
the two. So, now we have a way of selecting which flux or combination thereof
that we would like to use at any interface in our domain, we simply need to
detect where our discontinuities are located and ensure that in those regions we
have our stability maintaining high-dissipation flux calculator turned on.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the domain, we want to ensure that we are using the low
dissipation flux so that we can capture as much of the physics as possible. 

= Shock detection

The problem of detecting discontinuities is a challenging one and is an active
area of research. In Eilmer 4 we currently provide a single function for shock
detection that checks for compression and shear at an interface and compares
these values to some user defined threshold values. This approach results in our
shock detector value, or flux blending variable, S having a value of 0 or 1 and
can be seen in the <<shock_detecto, figure>> below, where the compression and
shear tolerances are -0.1 and 1.0, respectively.

From this figure it is clear that we are mostly capturing the shocks, but are
doing so in a manner that introduces sharp transitions between our selected flux
calculators. Having sharp transitions can introduce spurious oscillations into
the flow field and so we would prefer to have a smooth transition. This can be
achieved by calculating our variable S in such a way that it smoothly varies
from zero to one, depending on the local flow conditions, or we can apply a
post-processing step to spatially diffuse a binary shock detector. Eilmer 4 has
the second option implemented where S is spatially averaged as part of an
iterative process where information is propagated through faces and cells, as
described in the algorithm <<algorithm,below>>. Note that any cell that is
initially marked as a definite discontinuity, that is with S=1, is never
modified. Indeed, it can be seen that the averaging process treats these points
as a constant source that sustains the growth of the averaging wave-front. The
result of aplying smoothing can be seen in the following
<<smooth_shock_detector, figure>> where three averaging iterations have been
performed.

  end
end

= Practical considerations

In order to use the smoothing feature the user will need to know 
a number of configuration options:

`config.flux_calculator` ::
  _string_, default: `'adaptive_hanel_ausmdv'` +
  If a hybrid flux is desired then it must be 
  specified here. These are identified by the use of `adaptive' in 
  their names.

`config.shock_detector_smoothing` ::
  _int_, default: `0` +
  This determines the number of averaging 
  or smoothing iterations that are carried out. Note that each 
  iteration requires inter-block communication and so it is 
  somewhat expensive. The default is zero and so no smoothing takes 
  place.

`config.strict_shock_detector` :: 
  _boolean_, default: `true` +
  If this is true then any face that is part 
  of a cell with S>0 will have its own S value set to 1. This is to 
  emulate legacy behaviour and thus defaults to true. For true 
  blending of fluxes this should be set to false.
