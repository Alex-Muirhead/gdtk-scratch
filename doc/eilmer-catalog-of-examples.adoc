In the source tree for Eilmer, there are a number of examples of the simulation
code in action.
These examples have been collected and maintained over many years.
Some are well-tested and exercised, while others are more bleeding edge.
The hope is that all of the examples offer launching points for you
to start your own compressible flow simulations.

A number of these examples replicate classic test cases
in the CFD literature on compressible flows, or classic
experiments in high-speed flow.
The listing below provides a mapping directories in the source
tree to the literature.
They are grouped loosely by the type of flow/geometry configuration.
This is not a perfect grouping because the world of compressible
flow test cases is not always so easy to categorise.
