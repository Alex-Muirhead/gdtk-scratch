The loadable library is accessible from Python and Ruby.
It provides access to geometry functions for the construction of paths and surfaces
compatible with those available in the Eilmer flow solver.

This is the reference manual for the Python flavour of the library and,
because of the history of development, the library comes in the `eilmer` package.
For example, to construct a simple linear path element
from within your Python script and then evaluate the midpoint on that line,
you might try the following:

----
from eilmer.geom.vector3 import Vector3
from eilmer.geom.path import *

a = Vector3(0.0, 2.0)
b = Vector3(2.0, 0.0)
line_ab = Line(p0=a, p1=b)
print("line_ab=", line_ab)
c = line_ab(0.5)
----

If you have not yet read the
http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/pdfs/geometry-user-guide.pdf[Geometry Package User Guide],
this is a good time to do so.
