= Boundary Conditions

To complete a definition of a FluidBlock, boundary conditions for all
block boundaries, need to be specified.
These may be given as a list to the FluidBock constructor or
they may be attached to particular boundaries of an already existing
FluidBlock object.
In the absence of your specification, the default boundary condition
is a slip wall, `WallBC_WithSlip`.


== Walls

=== Slip wall

=== No-slip, fixed-temperature

=== No-slip, adiabatic

=== Translating-surface, fixed-temperature

=== Translating-surface, adiabatic

=== Rotating-surface, fixed-temperature

=== Rotating-surface, adiabatic


== In Flow

=== Simple supersonic

=== Static profile

=== Transient

=== Constant flux

=== Shock-fitting

=== Isentropic from stagnation


== Out Flow

=== Simple flux

=== Simple extrapolation

=== Fixed pressure

=== Fixed pressure and temperature


== User Defined
This is a get-out-of-jail boundary condition that allows you to do anything
you wish to code (in Lua).


== Inter-block Exchange

=== Full block-face

=== Mapped cell

=== Full block-face followed by user-defined
