= Surfaces (Patches)

Surfaces or patches are elements that are parameterised in with two
coordinates.
In our definition, those coordinates are `r` and `s`, and
the range for each is from `0.0` to `1.0`.
The surface itself can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
Two-dimensional surfaces are often used in structured grid generation
for 2D simulations.
For this use case, we often refer to these entities are patches.
Three-dimensional surfaces can be used to represent faces
on 3D volumes, so they often turn up in 3D grid generation.

In the following, the syntax for various surface types is given
and described.
We have also produced some grids from the various surface types
to give you some idea of the effect of surface type choice.
Three example geometries, covering a modest range of use cases, have been chosen for the demonstration:

. a blunt-body grid
. a converging-diverging nozzle grid
. a duct-like grid

== Coons patch

There are two constructors available for a Coons patch.
One accepts four `Path` objects, the other accepts four corner points ( `Vector3` s).
----
CoonsPatch:new{north, south, east, west}
----
----
CoonsPatch:new{p00, p10, p11, p01}
----

Example grids generated with a Coons patch are shown here.

== Area-orthogonal patch

The area-orthogonal patch attempts to equalise the areas
of cells and maintain orthogonality at the edges.
The constructor is:
----
AOPatch:new{north, south, east, west, nx=10, ny=10}
----

The `nx` and `ny` parameters control the background grid
used to build an area-orthogonal patch.
The default is 10 background-cells in each direction.
If you have boundaries that have sections high curvature
you may need to increase the number of background cells.

Example grids using the default `AOPatch` settings
are shown here.

image::nozzle-AO-patch-grid.png[width=50%,align=center]
image::duct-AO-patch-grid.png[width=50%,align=center]

Note that with default settings the blunt-body grid
results in negative cells near the shoulder
and the nozzle grid has cut the corner of the boundary.
This behaviour can be improved if some care is take
in selecting the background grid.
The next example, for the nozzle, increased the
background grid in the x-direction to `nx=40`
to give a better representation of the change
in geometry in the streamwise direction.
This is show here.
