= Cluster Functions

Cluster Functions are ways of deforming a grid to concentrate the cells in a given area. The most common use for a cluster function is to resolve the boundary layer near a viscous wall, though in hypersonic flow we sometimes cluster near shockwaves as well. Eilmer's native gridding tool has several cluster functions, a selection of which are documented as follows.

== Roberts Function

The Roberts function implmenents a gentle stretching toward a boundary that is controlled by a single parameter `beta`, which is always greater than one. Closer values to one result in tighter clustering. The two arguments `end0` and `end1` can be used to indicate which end the clustering should be applied, which can both if required.

This example clusters toward the beginning of a block boundary, with a relatively tight clustering of 1.01:

----
cf = RobertsFunction:new{end0=true, end1=false, beta=1.01}
----

== Geometric Function

The geometric function uses a geometric series to grow the cell sizes, starting from a small cell of size `a` and increasing to a second cell of size `ar`, then to a third size of `ar^2`, etc. Eventually, when the cluster function detects that the cells have grown large enough, it switches to a constant cell spacing for the rest of the block. The following example begins with a spacing of one-thousandth the block edge length, and grows by a factor of 1.2 with each step.

----
cf = GeometricFunction:new{a=0.001, r=1.2, N=60, reverse=false}
----

Note that the function needs the `N` argument, which is the number of nodes along the block boundary that is to be clustered, in this case 60. The function also takes a boolean parameter `reverse`, which can be used to start clustering on the other side of the block.

== Gaussian Function

The gaussian function applies a bell-curve shaped compression that can be useful for clustering in the middle of a block, perhaps to resolve a shockwave or other feature of interest. The function takes a nondimensional parameter `m` which can range from 0.0 to 1.0, defining the position of the clustered band; a nondimensional parameter `s` which defines the width of the band, and a parameter `ratio` which controls the tightness of the clustering, where smaller numbers are tighter. In the following example, the clustering is positioned at the 80% mark of the block boundary, using a narrow width of 0.2 and a fairly tight ratio of 0.1:

----
cf = GaussianFunction:new{m=0.8, s=0.1, ratio=0.1}
----

== Vinokur Function

The Vinokur function is designed to produce a smooth cell size distribution on an edge which has a constrained cell size at both ends.
The function requires the number of cells on the edge `n`, the normalised cell size at the start of the edge `s0` and the normalised cell size `s1` at the end of the edge as arguments.
Note, that the cell sizes are not preserved exactly and can vary significantly, in particular if the cell size varies strongly along the edge.
Should the grid generation fail with an error message saying `B<1!`, it means that the specified cell sizes are too large to produce a smooth distribution.
Increasing either cell size or reducing the number of cells will solve the problem.
The example below specifies a cell size of ten millionths of the edge length at the start and one millionth of the edge length at its end and a total of 50 cells.

----
cf = VinokurFunction:new{n=50, s0=1e-5, s1=1e-6}

== Vinokur-Geometric Function Hybrid

The Vinokur-Geometric Hybrid adds geometric series at either end of the cell distribution and uses the Vinokur function for the cell size distribution in between.
Geometric layers are useful to resolve boundary layers and are specified by a normalised starting cell size, a number of cells and a growth rate.
In the example below, the first cell is one hundred thousandths of the edge length long and cells two to five are larger than their predecessor by a factor of 1.2.
The last cell is one millionths of the edge length long and the nine preceding cells are each larger than the next cell by a factor of 1.1.
This function can also be used to achieve a Vinokur function distribution with exact cell sizes at the ends by setting `n0` and `r0` to one.
With zero cells in either geometric series the result of the hybrid is the same as the Vinokur function.

----
cf = VinokurGeomHybridFunction:new{n=50, s0=1e-5, n0=5, r0=1.2, s1=1e-6, n1=10, r1=1.1}
