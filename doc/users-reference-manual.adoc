In a nutshell, Eilmer is a gas flow simulation code.
The set up of a simulation involves writing an input script
that defines the domain of the gas flow as one or more FluidBlock objects
with initial gas flow states and prescribed boundary conditions.
Over small time steps, the code then updates the flow state
in each cell within the flow domain
according to the constraints of mass, momentum and energy,
thus allowing the flow to evolve subject to the applied boundary conditions.
The following sections provide brief details on many items that
might go into your input script.
