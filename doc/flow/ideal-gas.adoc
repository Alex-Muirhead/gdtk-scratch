= State-to-state processes (ideal gas)

If the calorically-perfect ideal gas model is sufficient for your analysis needs,
there is simple set of ideal-gas relations collected into the `eilmer.ideal_gas`
package.

The following functions do not use the generalized gas models but assume a gas bahaviour
for fixed ratio of specific heats.

== Normal shock

== Oblique shock
