## What does Eilmer do?

The Eilmer code is a program for the numerical simulation of transient,
compressible gas flows in two and three dimensions.
This program answers the "What if ... ?" type of question
where you will set up a flow situation by
defining the spatial domain in which the gas moves,
set an initial gas state throughout this domain,
specify boundary condition constraints to the edges of the domain and
then let the gas flow evolve according to the rules of gas dynamics.

Eilmer began life as a tool to simulate and aid in the of design shock tunnels and expansion tubes.
It has also been applied to the analysis of the experiments undertaken
in shock tunnels and expansion tubes and has being used for the simulation and design of
hypersonic inlets, turbomachinery and microcombustors.

## Features
