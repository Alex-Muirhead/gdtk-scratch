This section of the site is a one-stop shop to navigate
to all of the documentation collection.
We have grouped here by type so that returning users
can quickly find the documentation they seek.

The User Guides are a long format document.
They are intended to tell a story and should (hopefully) provide
a gentle introduction for new users of the code collection.
The Reference Manuals are more terse.
Their purpose is as online quick look-up for such things
as commands, function calls and configuration objects.
