## Equilibrium Shock Tunnel Conditions, with Nozzle

This program can be used to estimate flow conditions
for shock-processed flows typical of high-performance
shock-tunnels and expansion tubes.

The program can do a number of calculations from the command line:

* flow in a reflected shock tube with or without a nozzle
* pitot pressure from free-stream flow condition
* stagnation (total) condition from free-stream condition
* code surface condition from free-stream condition
