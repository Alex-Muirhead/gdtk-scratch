# Documentation

The GTDK documentation comes in a variety of styles, each for different purposes:
  + [The User Guides]({{< relref "user-guides.md" >}}) offer an introduction to use
    of the various simulation programs and supporting modules in the toolkit.
  + [The Reference Manuals]({{< relref "reference-manuals.md" >}}) are a terse
    but comprehensive documentation of all of the input parameters and functions
    available to the users.
  + [Presentation and seminars](({{< relref "presentations.md">}}) hosts a 
    collection of presentations that the developers have made over the years
    about the development and use of the toolkit.
