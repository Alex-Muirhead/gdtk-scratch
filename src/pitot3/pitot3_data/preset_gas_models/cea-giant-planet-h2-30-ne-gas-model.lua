-- giant planet with ions CEA backed gas model with increased neon instead of helium
-- using the Stalker substitution
-- This is based off a condition from the work of Yu Liu:
-- Liu et al (2020) Experimental validation of a test gas substitution for simulating 
-- nonâ€‘equilibrium giant planet entry conditions in impulse facilities
-- Experiments in Fluids
-- I kept the species the same as the Uranus entry gas model (but replaced He with Ne)
