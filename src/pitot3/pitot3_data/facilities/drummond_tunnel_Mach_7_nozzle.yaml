# I have made the shock tube length the length to the flange where the subsonic contour
# to the secondary diaphragm starts. Wasn't 100% sure what to do, but figured that the
# extra 39 mm over 3 m was not a big deal either way...

# in fact this is an effective ara ratio given for the nozzle
# this geometric area ratio is in fact 83.9**2.0/7.0**2.0 = 143.65
# the assignment said to use 90 so I have put that here...
