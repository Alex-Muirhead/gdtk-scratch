# X2's 95%He 2.0 mm driver condition with isentropic compression to the specified p4
# Fill pressue, temperature, and rupture pressure values from Table 3 of Gildfind et al. (2011)
# Free-piston driver optimisation for simulation of high Mach number scramjet flow conditions
# M_throat was calculated using the formula from Gildfind et al. (2015) 
# Free-piston driver performance characterisation using experimental shock speeds through helium
# This is a new driver condition that I made after realising that there is a much larger gap in performance
# between the 90 and 100% He conditions than the 80 to 90 % He conditions. This should plug the gap nicely.
