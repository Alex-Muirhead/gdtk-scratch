# x3r-560kg-piston-70pc-He-30pc-Ar-CR9-isentropic.yaml
# the X3R 560 kg piston design condition
# I wasn't really sure about the naming convention
# I should use as X3/X3R has so many conditions,
# but I figured that composition, piston mass, and CR are
# good things to do.
# driver condition details from Table 7.11 of
# Stennett (2020) Development of an Extended Test Time Operating Mode
# for a Large Reflected Shock Tunnel Facility
# 
# While this is 'nominally' a CR of 10 (see the isentropic version
# of this driver condition). This is the CR which matched the 
# measured shock speed for experiment x3s721 of 1450 m/s
# (see Table 7.15 of the thesis).
