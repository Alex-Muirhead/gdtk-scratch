# x3r-560kg-piston-70pc-He-30pc-Ar-CR9-isentropic.yaml
# the X3R 560 kg piston design condition
# I wasn't really sure about the naming convention
# I should use as X3/X3R has so many conditions,
# but I figured that composition, piston mass, and CR are
# good things to do.
# driver condition details from Table 7.11 of
# Stennett (2020) Development of an Extended Test Time Operating Mode
# for a Large Reflected Shock Tunnel Facility
# 
# I got the compression ratio from compressing the driver
# fill condition to get the measured rupture pressure for 
# X3/X3R shot x3s721 (see Table 7.14)
# BEWARE: this has no losses, will probably massively overpredict expected performance
# use the empirical version of this driver condition to get more realistic results...
