The start of a 3D flow solver written in CUDA C++.

So far this is just an experiment to see if we can write the CUDA code
in similar form to the Eilmer and Puffin codes, so that we can reuse
our Dlang code base for geometric elements and flux calculators.

  Initial hack adapts the vector addition example from the CUDA workshop
  to look a bit closer to our Puffin CFD code.

  Start the process of making it a real flow simulation code.

  The basic inviscid compressible flow solver for CPU is complete enough
  to do some simple calculations such as the Sod shock tube, supersonic flow
  over a simple ramp and a periodic shear layer.

  Start the real GPU variant, with all of the GPU action limited to the
  march_in_time function in the simulate.cu file.
