# Run-time commands for Eilmer steady-state solver (solver_mode = "steady")
#
# This is a default file. The examples below are chosen to DO NOTHING to
# alter the run-time behaviour as requested during initial configuration.
#
# You will need to make explicit edits and save the file to activate
# your desired commands.
#
# Commands are executed in an order of priority. That order is:
#    1. Commands related to writing actions
#    2. Commands related to stopping the simulation
#    3. Commands related to modifying the Newton-Krylov stepping
#
# Note 1. If you want to write a snapshot and exit, then set the appropriate
#         write command (since it will be executed first) and the appropriate
#         stop command.
#
# Note 2. This file may not be read on every step. There is a configuration setting
#         to control how often the file is read. Actions only occur on the step when
#         the file is re-read. That configuration setting is part of the Newton-Krylov
#         settings and is called "steps_between_commands_update".
#
# Note 3. The run-time will never alter this file. So try to avoid the mistake of
#         attempting to restart a simulation with the setting:
#
#           stop:
#             at-next-check: yes
#
#         If you have used such a setting, you will need to reset it yourself
#         on a restart. This applies to all settings in this file. You will need
#         to choose what is appropriate for a restart.
#
#         To help with restarts, we provide a command the user can call:
#         > lmr restore-default-run-time-commands
#

write-snapshot:
  at-next-check: no
  at-check-after-step: -1

stop:
  at-next-check: no
  at-check-after-step: -1
